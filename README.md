Monday Milestones

**All Project's file structures scaffolded and project architecture decided.
**Backend will use Node/Express and all required packages for things like CORS, Body-Parser, JWT.
**User Login/Signup endpoints and features built out including the User Models. Front and Backend. Use JWT/Sessions strategies learned in Authentication here (unless agreed upon by the team and scrum master to move with an OAuth strategy).
**Data Migrations and Seeds set up for mock data.
